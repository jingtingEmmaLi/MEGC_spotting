# MEGC_spotting
The projet dedicates to the Second Facial Micro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC): Spotting and Recognition - spotting part (workshop og FG2019 ).
It includes two methods : LTP-ML and LBP

The location of landmarks for regions of interest is not uploaded because it depends on the facial landmarks detection tool. The landmarks index would be different for different detection tools. Hence, please generate your own nbROI.mat. The correspondance table for landmarks and the ROIs table can be found in :

In my case: nbROI = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 32, 35, 38, 41]
